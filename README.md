##Overview
- The intent of this project is as a fun, demonstrated use-case of the often overlooked ability to turn interactive, localized html files within ERC & Metaplex Standard (Ethereum & Solana based contracts)

## Features:
1. a lil plotline
2. user color customizability
3. level difficulty options

## Version Log:

### v0.0.1
- working game mechanics (player movement, collision, item collection, score)
